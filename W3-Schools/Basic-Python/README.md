* Remember all of this code still in comment status. Don't forget to exclude both of the '''.

* The naming of the file refer to python number index, exm:
  
  * 0.0 => first 0 means first tens and second 0 means file number 1 (as per python index 1=0; 2=1; etc), this also means the              file is file number 1
  * 1.3 => 1 means second tens and 3 means file number 4, this also means the file is file number 14
