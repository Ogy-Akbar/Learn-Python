#8 Python - Output Variables

'''
* print() function is used to output variables
	ex: 
	x = "Python is awesome"
	print(x)

* print() to output multiple variables separated by commas
	ex:
	x = "Python"
	y = "is"
	z = "awesome"
	print(x, y, z)

* use the + operator to output multiple variables
	ex: 
	x = "Python "
	y = "is "
	z = "awesome"
	print(x + y + z)
 '''
	
	remember to use space after the word (except the last word) so the 	final result won't combined. except comma, it will give space 	automatically

* Python will give error if try to combine two different types of variables ex: number + string. The only to combine it is by giving comma instead of +
