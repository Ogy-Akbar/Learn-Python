#5 Python Variables

'''
* Python has no command for declaring a variable, Variable do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

* Casting: To specify the data type of a variable
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

* Get The Type: can get the data type of variable with the type() function
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

* Quotes: String canbe declared using single or double quotes
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

* Case Sensitive: Two variable of a and A are different variables
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
