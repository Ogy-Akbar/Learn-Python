#18 Python - Escape Characters

'''
* to insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character
* The Escape Character is a backlash \ followed by the character you want to insert

exp.:
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

* this will return an error, so backlash is needed.

exp.:
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

Other Escape Characters are:
\'	Single Quote	
\\	Backslash	
\n	New Line	
\r	Carriage Return	
\t	Tab	
\b	Backspace	
\f	Form Feed	
\ooo	Octal value	
\xhh	Hex value

* Carriage Return is used to move the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line
